This is the documentation for the Polar Trig Shiny App, which can be found at https://meehank.shinyapps.io/polartrig/


This simple app is designed to allow fun interactive exploration of graphs, in a polar coordinate system, of functions of the form
  
# $r = \sin(\frac n d \theta)$ 

Use the sliders to control *n* and *d*, the angle coefficient numerator and denominator.

You can also control  

* the step size between successive values of $\theta$  
    + *measured in degrees*
* the type of graph  
    + points
    + lines
    + points & lines
    + histogram-like
    + stair steps
* the type of lines
    + solid  
    + dashed  
    + dotted  
    + dotdash  
* the width of lines  
* color  
    + of graph
    + of background
* the zoom factor
    + to explore dense graphs
